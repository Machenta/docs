## Key Features

### Content Safety

All AI-generated content passes through Azure Content Safety checks before being returned. This ensures:

- Appropriate language for school environments
- Compliance with safety guidelines
- No harmful or inappropriate suggestions

### Version Tracking

Every edit creates a traceable record. You can:

- View the history of changes to any plan section
- See who requested changes and when
- Compare versions to understand what was modified

### Customizable AI Behavior

Through the [Admin Dashboard](/customization/dashboard), prompt owners can:

- Adjust the AI's tone and style
- Set guardrails for content generation
- Configure model settings without code changes

## What this page will contain

This page is reserved for the Quick Reference Guide (QRG) integration surface. It will document the endpoints, request/response shapes, and workflows specific to creating, publishing, and retrieving QRGs once they are finalized.

## How to work today

- Author and review QRG content alongside the corresponding EOP annex so the two stay aligned.
- Use your delivery channel (CMS, PDF generation, or app UI) to publish QRGs while the dedicated API surface is being finalized.
- Track a stable QRG identifier and its source EOP annex ID so you can remap content when QRG tooling ships.

## Planned coverage

- QRG create/update/read endpoints or tools, including required identifiers and status vocabulary.
- Expected payload fields (title, scenario, steps, roles, contact/owner, prerequisites, last-reviewed).
- Versioning and publication states so downstream apps can detect stale content.
- Webhook or polling approach for clients once QRG workflows are available.

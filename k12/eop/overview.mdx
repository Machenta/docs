## What is an EOP (Emergency Operations Plan)

An Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) is the guiding document that outlines how a school or district prepares for, responds to, and recovers from emergencies. Within K12 Safety, an EOP contains annexes (sections) that may be edited or clarified through the annex editing workflow.

## Why K12 Safety surfaces EOP snapshots

- Ensure edits target a specific plan version when multiple plan revisions exist.
- Provide context (plan metadata) to editors and the agent so changes are accurate.
- Allow teams to fetch and review snapshots before applying edits.

## Integrating with EOP flows

- Provide `emergencyOperationPlanId` on kickoff to target a plan snapshot.
- Use `k12-get-emergency-operation-plan-snapshot` to retrieve plan metadata and versions.
- When calling the kickoff tool, pass the form field containing the content you want to edit along with optional `prompt` instructions.

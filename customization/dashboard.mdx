# Admin Dashboard

The Admin Dashboard is a web-based interface that allows you to customize AI agent behavior without writing code. From the dashboard you can:

- **Edit system prompts** — change the instructions that guide how agents respond
- **Select AI models** — choose which deployment and model an agent uses
- **Tune generation settings** — adjust creativity, response length, and other parameters
- **Track changes** — view version history and revert to previous configurations

<Info>
Your organization's Admin Dashboard URL is provided by your IT team or system administrator. If you need APIM authentication, append `?subscription-key=YOUR_KEY` to the URL.
</Info>

## Navigating the Dashboard

The dashboard has two main sections:

| Section | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| **LLM Parameters** | Global defaults for AI model behavior (temperature, response length, etc.) |
| **Agent Profiles** | Per-agent customization (system prompts, model overrides, notes) |

---

## LLM Parameters (Global Defaults)

Use this section to set organization-wide defaults for AI behavior. These settings apply to all agents unless overridden at the agent level.

### What you can configure

| Setting | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **Deployment** | The Azure OpenAI deployment to use |
| **Temperature** | Controls creativity (0 = focused, 1 = creative) |
| **Top P** | Alternative creativity control (nucleus sampling) |
| **Max Output Tokens** | Maximum response length |
| **Frequency Penalty** | Reduces repetition of words |
| **Presence Penalty** | Encourages new topics |
| **Notes** | Internal notes for your team |

### How to edit global defaults

1. Select a deployment card from the list
2. Adjust the sliders or input fields
3. Click **Save** to apply changes

<Tip>
Some settings may be disabled if the selected model doesn't support them. The dashboard automatically hides or locks unsupported options.
</Tip>

### Version history

Every save creates a new version. Click the **History** toggle on any card to view and restore previous configurations.

---

## Agent Profiles (Per-Agent Settings)

Use this section to customize individual agents. Each agent can have its own system prompt, model selection, and generation settings.

### What you can configure

| Field | Required | Description |
| ----- | -------- | ----------- |
| **Agent ID** | Yes | The unique identifier for the agent |
| **Alias** | No | A friendly name for display |
| **System Prompt** | Yes | Instructions that define how the agent behaves |
| **Notes** | No | Internal notes for your team |
| **Metadata** | No | Additional configuration (JSON format) |
| **Model Overrides** | No | Override the global deployment/model for this agent |
| **Generation Overrides** | No | Override temperature, max tokens, etc. for this agent |

### How to edit an agent profile

1. Find the agent in the list or use the search/filter
2. Click **Edit** on the agent card
3. Update the system prompt, notes, or any override settings
4. Click **Save**

The dashboard will show the new version and update the agent card.

### Understanding overrides

Agents inherit global LLM parameters by default. When you set an override:

- **Model override** — The agent uses a different deployment/model than the global default
- **Generation override** — The agent uses different temperature/max tokens/etc.

The dashboard shows **Resolved values** so you can see the effective configuration after all overrides are applied.

### Version history and rollback

Each save creates a new version of the agent profile. To restore a previous version:

1. Click **History** on the agent card
2. Find the version you want
3. Click **Use this version** to load it into the editor
4. Review and click **Save** to apply

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Writing effective system prompts">
    - Be specific about the agent's role and audience
    - Include examples of desired response format
    - Specify any constraints (length, tone, topics to avoid)
    - Test changes with representative queries before rolling out
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Choosing temperature settings">
    - **Lower (0.0–0.3)** — Best for factual, consistent responses (compliance, data extraction)
    - **Medium (0.4–0.7)** — Balanced creativity and accuracy (general assistance)
    - **Higher (0.8–1.0)** — Best for creative tasks (brainstorming, drafting)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Managing multiple agents">
    - Use clear, descriptive Agent IDs and Aliases
    - Document changes in the Notes field
    - Review version history before making major changes
    - Coordinate with your team when editing shared agents
  </Accordion>

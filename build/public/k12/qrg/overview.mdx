## What is a QRG

A Quick Reference Guide (QRG) is a concise, action-focused card that summarizes how to respond to a specific incident. QRGs are meant to be read in the moment, so they focus on clear steps, roles, and checklists rather than lengthy policy text.

## How QRGs relate to EOPs

- QRGs are derived from the same Emergency Operations Plan (EOP) annex content but condensed for fast reading.
- Each QRG should map back to the source EOP section so updates stay in sync.
- QRGs favor short, scannable steps and role assignments; EOPs retain the detailed rationale and policy references.

## How to organize QRGs

- Keep a stable identifier (or slug) per QRG and map it to the originating EOP annex ID.
- Store the current version and last-reviewed date so field teams know the material is current.
- Pair each QRG with a contact/owner and a short list of prerequisites (equipment, roles, escalation paths).

## Navigate this section

- QRG overview (this page) for intent and structure.
- QRG reference (`/k12/qrg/reference`) to collect the API/workflow details as they come online.
- EOP references if you need the full annex context: `/k12/eop/overview`, `/k12/external-reference`, `/k12/internal-reference`.

## Current status

We are treating QRGs as a sibling to EOP documentation. As the QRG-specific tooling/API surface is finalized, the reference page below will capture request/response shapes, workflows, and status vocabulary. Until then, use your publishing channel (CMS, PDF, or app) to surface QRG content derived from the EOP annex edits.
